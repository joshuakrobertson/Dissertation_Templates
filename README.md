# Dissertation_Templates

This repository contains .cls files to be used for construction of a dissertation in Latex. Files within this repository include:

1) TrentThesis.cls - A basic .cls file to construct a dissertation without the intention of document binding.
2) ThesisBook.cls - A more involved .cls file to construct a dissertation document for binding on A5 paper. Margins and headers are adjusted accordingly.
3) CustomBook.cls - A stripped .cls template (albeit, with many superfluous lines carried over from the thesis template .cls files) to be used for rendering a simple book on A5 paper.
